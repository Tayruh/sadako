# Sadako

Sadako is a javascript library for creating hyperlink based interactive fiction similar to [Twine](https://twinery.org/), [ChoiceScript](https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/), and [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/). Sadako is my attempt at merging Twine-like markup and Ink-like choice trees into a cohesive scripting language that I call *Sadako script*.

A guide on how to setup an HTML page to being working with Sadako can be viewed [here](getting-started.md).

A reference and guide on how to use Sadako script can be viewed [here](reference.md).

The JavaScript reference is [here](javascript_reference.md).

**[Rainy Day](https://tayruh.github.io/rainy_day/)** is a simple demo of Sadako in action. You can find its commented source code [here](https://github.com/Tayruh/tayruh.github.io/tree/master/rainy_day).

A more complex demo is my personal game in progress, **[Monster](https://tayruh.github.io/monster/)**. Its source code is [here](https://github.com/Tayruh/tayruh.github.io/tree/master/monster).
