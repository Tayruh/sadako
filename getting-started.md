### Setting up the HTML

**Sadako** doesn't require too much to run. Just a few lines of HTML and two javascript function calls.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <style type="text/css">
            a.link {
                cursor: pointer;
                color: orange;
            }

            .choice { font-size: 1.1em; }

            #source { display: none; }

            .hide {
                transition: opacity initial;
                opacity: 0;
            }

            :not(.hide) {
                transition: opacity 400ms ease-in;
                opacity: 1;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="output"></div>
        <textarea id="source">
            ## start
                Hello world
                + Choice one[] was chosen.
                    Maybe try choice two next time?
                + Choice two[] was chosen.
                    Maybe try choice one next time?
                - The End
        </textarea>
    </body>
    <script src="sadako.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="kayako.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        sadako.init();
        sadako.startGame();
    </script>
</html>
```

For the HTML:

The `output` div is the default target for displaying the story output.

The `source` textarea tag is where you write the story. It's recommended to use a textarea tag so you can safely write characters normally reserved for HTML tags like `<` and `>` signs.

For the CSS, there are a few reserved classes and IDs to style:

* `a.link`: The hyperlinks generated by **Sadako** do not use the `href` attribute, and so the browser treats them as normal text instead of links. Each hyperlink is assigned a `link` class though, so you can style them to look like normal links, which is what this CSS does.
* `choice`: Choices are links and use the `link` class, but they also have their own additional class.  You can style them using this.
* `#source`: This is the default source code ID where you will write your game. This CSS just hides it from view.
* `.hide`: This is completely optional, but **Sadako** adds a `hide` class to elements in the text output. It then removes that class after a certain amount of time (defined in `sadako.text_delay`). This gives the text a nice fade in effect. If you dislike this effect, remove this class from the CSS. If you want it to fade in uniformly instead of one line at a time, set `sadako.text_delay` to `0`. The `hide` class also affects the fading in of reveal links.

For the functions:

* `sadako.init()`: Initializes the **Sadako** library. By default, Sadako uses the HTML element with the ID `source` for its story script and `output` for the text output. You can change this by passing different IDs to the function. Be sure to begin the ID names with `#`. For example:
`sadako.init("#source_ID", "#text_output_ID")`.

* `sadako.startGame()`: Starts the game, as you would imagine. It starts the game on the `start` page by default. You can start it on a different page if you pass the name of it to the function. For example:
`sadako.startGame("different_page")`.

That's basically it. You now have a running game.

#### Setting up a Dialog Box

If you do not define a dialog box, dialog actions will be disabled. To define a dialog box, you must create one in HTML and then call `sadako.setupDialog()` with the respective IDs. The following is an example on how to do this.

Here is an example with a working dialog box.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <style type="text/css">
            a.link {
                cursor: pointer;
                color: orange;
            }

            .choice { font-size: 1.1em; }

            #source { display: none; }

            .hide {
                transition: opacity initial;
                opacity: 0;
            }

            :not(.hide) {
                transition: opacity 400ms ease-in;
                opacity: 1;
            }

            #dialog:not(.open), #dialog-overlay:not(.open) {
                transition: visibility 200ms step-end, opacity 200ms ease-in;
                visibility: hidden;
                opacity: 0;
            }

            #dialog.open, #dialog-overlay.open {
                transition: opacity 200ms ease-in;
                visibility: visible;
                opacity: 1;
            }

            #dialog-overlay {
                background-color: #000;
                position: fixed;
                top: 0;
                left: 0;
                height: 100%;
                width: 100%;
                z-index: 100;
            }
            #dialog-overlay.open { opacity: 0.4; }

            #dialog {
                position: fixed;
                top: 5vh;;
                left: 50%;
                transform: translate(-50%);
                padding: 0;
                z-index: 200;
                color: black;
                background-color: white;
            }

            #dialog-title, #dialog-output {
                min-width: 200px;
                margin: auto;
                padding: 0.5em;
                z-index: 250;
            }

            #dialog-title {
                text-align: center;
                background-color: silver;
                color: black;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="output"></div>

        <div id="dialog-overlay" onclick="sadako.closeDialog()"></div>
        <div id="dialog">
            <div id="dialog-title"></div>
            <div id="dialog-output"></div>
        </div>

        <textarea id="source">
            ## start
                Hello world
                [:* Hello world! @: Dialog Test:]
                + Choice one[] was chosen.
                    Maybe try choice two next time?
                + Choice two[] was chosen.
                    Maybe try choice one next time?
                - The End
        </textarea>
    </body>
    <script src="sadako.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="kayako.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        sadako.init();
        sadako.setupDialog("#dialog-output", "#dialog-title", ["#dialog", "#dialog-overlay"]);
        sadako.startGame();
    </script>
</html>
```

Again, you can just copy and paste this code to begin.

The most complex parts of this code change is the CSS, which you don't need to worry too much about. But the basic idea is that in order to show or hide dialog items, an `open` class is added to the dialog. In other words, the dialog components should be hidden to begin and then the `open` class makes it visible. This is basically the reverse of the `hide` class described above.

Before we can use a dialog window, we need to declare its IDs. This is done using `sadako.setupDialog()`. The first argument is where the dialog text will be written, the second is the title of the dialog window (use `undefined` if you don't want a title), and the third is an array of all the HTML elements to show/hide when you open/close the dialog window.

That's everything. Just use either of those examples as your starter game and then head on over to the [reference](reference.md) to learn how to write a game in *sadako script*.
