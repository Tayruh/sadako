There are two ways to use Sadako. You can either write the sadako script right into the page using a <textarea> tag with the ID of "source", or you can precompile your script into a JSON .js file using the Kayako compiler for including in the page via a script tag.

If you decide to precompile it, you don't need to include kayako.js in your page. It's only for compiling when the page loads.

For an example of a game demo using a precompiled script, check out the example folder in the root folder.
