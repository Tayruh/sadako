There are two ways to use **Sadako**. You can either write the sadako script right into the page using a `<textarea>` tag with the ID of `source`, or you can precompile your script into a JSON .js file using the **Kayako** compiler for including in the page via a `<script>` tag.

`demo.html` in this folder is a very minimal example of how you would set up your page if you were to write your script inside the HTML page itself.

For an example of a game demo using a precompiled script, check out the `example` folder in the root folder of this project.
